## Thoughts

Thundercat blends so many different genres together on this album in a way that got me to enjoy new genres that I had never listened to before. The whole album gives off a very chill vibe throughout it's runtime despite how dark some of the the lyrics are. This album also has some of the most interesting juxtaposition from the dreamy and psychedelic instrumentals to straightforward relatable topics that give into a shared human experience for many people in our generation that have grown up with a love of anime, video games, and music.
