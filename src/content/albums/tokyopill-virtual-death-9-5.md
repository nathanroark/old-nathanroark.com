## Thoughts

This is the first Breakcore album that I was really interested in. There are a lot of interesting sounds and very hauntingly beautiful synths coming in on so much of this thing. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys any amount of Breakcore.

This album is missing several songs on streaming services, I recommend finding other ways to listen to it like their [Bandcamp](https://tokyopill.bandcamp.com/album/virtual-death-9-5?from=band_sub)
